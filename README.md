Project Summary: Predicting IMDb Movie Ratings

Aim:
Our goal was to use machine learning to predict IMDb movie ratings using factors like release year, votes, duration, genre ratings, and details about directors and actors.

Objectives:
- Cleaned and prepared the IMDb dataset for analysis.
- Added new features like the number of actors and genres per movie.
- Trained models to forecast movie ratings, comparing Linear Regression and RandomForestRegressor.
- Explored the data to find insights into what influences movie ratings.

Steps I followed:
- Cleaned up the IMDb data and made sure it was ready for analysis.
- Developed new ways to understand the data by adding new details.
- Taught computers how to predict movie ratings, and figured out which method worked best.
- Looked closely at the data to find important details that affect how movies are rated.

Results:
- Both models did well, but RandomForestRegressor was better at predicting movie ratings.
- I found out which factors, like the director and the type of movie, have the biggest impact on how movies are rated.
- This project showed how we can use computers to predict how well movies will do on IMDb, giving us a clearer picture of what makes a movie a hit.
