LinkedIn Project Summary: Iris Flower Classification with Logistic Regression

🎯 Aim:
Develop a reliable classification model to predict Iris flower species using machine learning techniques, focusing on Logistic Regression.

🔍 Objectives:
- Prepare and preprocess the Iris dataset, addressing missing values and outliers.
- Train Logistic Regression alongside Decision Tree and Random Forest models.
- Evaluate models based on accuracy scores and confusion matrices.
- Select the best-performing model for predicting new Iris species.

🛠️ Steps I Followed:
- Data Preparation: Cleaned the Iris dataset, handled missing values and removed outliers. Visualized data with pair plots and correlation heatmaps. Scaled features for optimal model performance.
- Model Training and Evaluation: Trained Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models. Evaluated models using accuracy scores and confusion matrices.
- Results and Best Model: Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy of 97.78%. I used it to predict new Iris species confidently.


📈 Takeaways:
- Effective data preprocessing is crucial for model accuracy.
- Logistic Regression demonstrated superior performance for the Iris dataset.
